Ideas for interesting projects

* **atom-typescript-jsodoc**
 
  Typescript jsdoc comments like how Visual Studio generates xmldoc C#. It
  would be cool if type information was automatically progagated into the comment and
  automatically updated if the function definition changed.
  
* ** atom bypass trash **
  
  Patch for Atom on Windows so that if the recycling bin is disabled, files in the tree-view are permanently deleted.
